# Project Name
City Builder Game

### Project Summary
> Give a short summary of your game project.
The plan for this City Builder Game is a multiplayer real-time strategy game where players compete on a shared map to build the most profitable city. Using their initial funds, players purchase tiles and construct residential, commercial, and industrial buildings, with each type serving different purposes in the city's ecosystem. The core challenge revolves around strategically placing buildings to keep residents happy through nearby jobs and entertainment, as happy residents generate twice the income of unhappy ones, ultimately driving players to climb the competitive leaderboard.
The game is not finished, but we have created a demo using Unity that is playable. The Unity demo is fully functional for all game features, but does not use Dojo and is simply a single player representation of what the game might look like when it is more developed.
Using Dojo and Three.js we have been able to create an app that allows players to create an account using a burner address, allows players to buy tiles, and tracks players' money on a leaderboard. This app is not yet functional as a game and can only be run locally.
